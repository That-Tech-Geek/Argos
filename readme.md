# Argos: Algorithmic Regulatory Guardian with Explainable Systems
## Introduction
Inspired by the vigilant hundred-eyed giant of Greek mythology, Argos safeguards the algorithmic trading landscape with cutting-edge AI and explainable systems. It empowers financial institutions to ensure their trading practices adhere to ever-evolving regulations, fostering trust and transparency within the financial system.
### Core Functionality
* In-Depth Algorithmic Analysis: Argos meticulously dissects algorithmic trading strategies, leveraging explainable AI techniques to identify potential legal and regulatory violations. This goes beyond mere detection, providing clear explanations that build trust and facilitate human oversight.
* Customizable Regulatory Landscape: Tailor Argos to your specific needs by defining the relevant regulations based on jurisdiction or asset class. This ensures the analysis aligns with the specific regulatory environment you operate in.
* Real-time Monitoring (Optional - Future Development): For future development, Argos can be extended to continuously monitor trading activity for suspicious patterns in real-time. This provides an extra layer of vigilance and reduces the risk of potential violations.
## Benefits
