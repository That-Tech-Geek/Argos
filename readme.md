# Argos: Stock Scoring Application

This is a **Stock Scoring Application** built using **Streamlit**. The app fetches stock market data and evaluates a stock ticker based on various metrics like rolling means, VIX volatility data, RSI (Relative Strength Index), financial ratios, and candlestick pattern analysis to provide an overall score for the stock.

## Features

- **Rolling Means**: Calculates 7-day, 50-day, and 200-day rolling averages for both the opening and closing prices of the stock.
- **VIX Data**: Fetches the VIX (Volatility Index) for multiple timeframes including 1 year, 1 month, 1 day, 1 hour, and 1 minute.
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Determines the percentage of time the stock was overbought or oversold using a custom RSI calculation (without TA-Lib).
- **Financial Ratios**: Fetches financial ratios such as Price-to-Earnings (P/E), Price-to-Book (P/B), Return on Equity (ROE), Debt-to-Equity, and Current Ratio to evaluate the stock's financial health.
- **Candlestick Pattern Analysis**: Performs quantitative analysis of candlestick patterns to assess trends and patterns in stock prices.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Required libraries:
    - [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
    - [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)
    - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
    - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run stock_scoring_app.py
    ```

2. Once the app starts, enter the stock ticker in the input box (e.g., `AAPL` for Apple) and click the **Get Stock Score** button.

3. The app will fetch stock data, perform calculations, and display the overall score for the selected ticker.

## Application Logic

The stock score is calculated using the following components:

1. **Rolling Means**:
    - `7d`, `50d`, `200d` averages of both the opening and closing prices.
  
2. **VIX (Volatility Index)**:
    - VIX values are fetched for multiple intervals (1 year, 1 month, 1 day, 1 hour, 1 minute) and averaged.

3. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**:
    - A custom function is used to calculate RSI from stock data, and the percentage of time the stock is in an overbought (RSI > 70) or oversold (RSI < 30) condition is considered.

4. **Financial Ratios**:
    - Key financial ratios like P/E, P/B, ROE, Debt-to-Equity, and Current Ratio are fetched from Yahoo Finance.

5. **Candlestick Patterns**:
    - Quantitative analysis of candlestick patterns is performed to provide insights into the stockâ€™s price trends and potential reversals.

The scoring formula combines these metrics to produce an overall score. Each component is weighted to reflect its importance.

## Example

To get a stock score for **Apple (AAPL)**:
- Enter `AAPL` in the input box and click **Get Stock Score**.
- The app will display the overall score based on its market performance and financial metrics.
