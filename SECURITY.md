# Argos: Security Policy
## Introduction
* Argos, an AI-powered tool for analyzing algorithmic trading strategies for potential legal and regulatory violations, prioritizes secure development practices. This Security Policy outlines our commitment to responsible development and security considerations.
## Security First Approach
We adhere to a "Security First" approach throughout Argos' development lifecycle:
* Secure Coding Practices: We employ secure coding techniques to minimize vulnerabilities like SQL injection or buffer overflows.
* Regular Code Reviews: Regular code reviews identify and address potential security issues.
* Dependency Management: Secure dependency management mitigates risks associated with third-party libraries.
* Vulnerability Scanning: We utilize vulnerability scanning tools to identify and patch known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
## Data Security
* User Data Privacy: Argos does not collect or store any user data related to the analyzed algorithmic trading strategies.
* Regulatory Data Security (if applicable): If Argos retrieves regulatory data from external sources, secure protocols will be used for access and storage.
## Transparency and Disclosure
* Responsible Disclosure: We are committed to responsible disclosure of any security vulnerabilities identified in Argos. We will work to address them promptly and provide updates to the community.
* Security Advisories: We will utilize security advisories on platforms like GitHub Security Advisories to communicate vulnerabilities and their fixes.
## Community Involvement
* We encourage the security research community to participate in responsible disclosure practices. Please report any suspected vulnerabilities to [insert email address or other designated reporting mechanism]. We appreciate your contributions to improving Argos's security.
## Disclaimer
* **This Security Policy is subject to change. We encourage you to review it periodically for updates.**
